# Internship Project Overview

## Description
This project was the subject of my Internship in Spain at the University of Cantabria. The primary goal was to utilize GNS3 to deploy simple network topologies and develop software to remotely change device operation using NETCONF.

## Achievements

### Network Topology Design
- Designed a network topology in GNS3 for network administration.

### Device Configuration
- Enabled DHCP and NAT on each device, specifically Cisco CSR 1000v.
- Incorporated the NETCONF protocol for network management.
- Established SSH connections between the administrator and each device simultaneously.

### Python Script Development
- Created Python scripts to perform various tasks:
  - Altered network interfaces.
  - Managed IP addresses.
  - Retrieved device configurations.
  - Created and deleted DHCP servers on network devices.
  
### Dynamic DHCP Server Management
- Developed a Python automation script to adjust, create, or delete DHCP server configurations based on the number of clients connected to each device.

## Deliverable
- Please refer to my comprehensive [report](/Internship%20Report%20V2/main.pdf), which includes an overview of NETCONF-YANG, XML, RPC, and details all the steps for the implementation.

## Troubleshooting
- For any issues I encountered and their respective solutions, please see the ISSUES section.
