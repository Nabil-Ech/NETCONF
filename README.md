Overview:
It's the subject of my Internship in Spain at the University of Cantabria. My goal is to use GNS3 to deploy simple network topologies and develop simple software to remotely change device operation using NETCONF
Achievements:
    Designing a network topology in GNS3 for network administration.
    Enabling DHCP, NAT on each device (Cisco CSR 1000v)
    Incorporating the NETCONF protocol.
    Establishing SSH connection between the administrator ans each device simultaneously 
    Creating Python scripts to:
            Alter network interfaces.
            Manage IP addresses.
            Getting devices configurations
            Create and delete DHCP servers on network devices.
    Developing a Python automation to adjust/create/delete DHCP server configurations based on the number of clients connected to each device.
Deliverable:
    Feel free to check my report which include and overview of NETCONF-YANG, XML, RPC, but also all the steps for the implementation.
Troubleshooting: 
    See the ISSUES section where I shared the problems I had faced and solutions.
