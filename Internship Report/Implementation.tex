\chapter{Implementation}

\section{GNS-3}

GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3) software allows us to emulate complex network designs such as Cisco Router/Switch.

It enables to run real Cisco IOS images using Dynamips in the GNS3 infrastructure, and with this software, we can create complex network designs on our computer and study in more detail for exams such as Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP), but in the context of this internship, we will exploit the GNS-3 to deploy simple network topologies and develop a simple software (preferably in Python) to remotely modify the devices operation using NETCONF.
